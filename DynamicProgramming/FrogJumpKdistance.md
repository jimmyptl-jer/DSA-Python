Sure, I can help with that. The "Frog Jump K Distance" problem involves a frog that can jump a maximum of \( K \) distances and needs to reach the end of a given distance array, where each element in the array represents the cost to land on that stone.

Here’s a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem:

### Problem Statement
You are given an array of costs where `cost[i]` is the cost to land on the i-th stone. The frog can jump from the i-th stone to any of the next \( K \) stones. The goal is to find the minimum cost to reach the last stone.

### Approach

1. **Initialize the DP Array**:
   - Let `dp[i]` be the minimum cost to reach stone `i`.

2. **Base Case**:
   - `dp[0] = cost[0]` (The cost to land on the first stone is just the cost of the first stone itself).

3. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - For each stone `i`, calculate the minimum cost to reach `i` by considering all possible previous stones `j` from which you can jump to `i` (i.e., from `i-K` to `i-1`):
     \[
     dp[i] = \min(dp[j] + cost[i])
     \]
     where \( \max(0, i-K) \leq j < i \).

4. **Result**:
   - The minimum cost to reach the last stone will be stored in `dp[n-1]` where `n` is the length of the cost array.

### Example Code in Python

Here’s a Python implementation of the above approach:

```python
class Solution:
    def minimizeCost(self, height, n, k):
        # code here
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        
        dp = [float('inf')] * n
        dp[0] = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(1, k+1):
                if i - j >= 0:
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - j] + abs(height[i] - height[i - j]))
        
        return dp[-1]

# Example usage
cost = [10, 30, 40, 50, 20]
K = 2
print(min_cost_frog_jump(cost, K))  # Output will be the minimum cost to reach the last stone
```

### Explanation
- We use a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to reach stone `i`.
- For each stone `i`, we look at the previous \( K \) stones to find the minimum cost to get to `i`.
- The result will be in `dp[-1]` which gives the minimum cost to reach the last stone.
