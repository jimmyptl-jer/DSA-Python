It looks like you're working on a problem where a frog is trying to jump across a series of heights and you want to compute the minimum energy required. The provided code seems to have some issues that need fixing. Hereâ€™s a corrected version:

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumEnergy(self, height, n):
        # Handle edge cases
        if not height or n == 0:
            return 0
        
        if n == 1:
            return 0

        # Initialize dp array
        dp = [float('inf')] * n

        # Base cases
        dp[0] = 0
        dp[1] = abs(height[1] - height[0])

        # Fill the dp array
        for i in range(2, n):
            jump_one = dp[i-1] + abs(height[i] - height[i-1])
            jump_two = dp[i-2] + abs(height[i] - height[i-2])
            dp[i] = min(jump_one, jump_two)
        
        return dp[-1]
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Initialization and Indexing:**
   - Changed `dp = [0] * (n+1)` to `dp = [0] * n` because we only need `n` elements.
   - Adjusted `dp` indices to ensure correct base cases and loop bounds.

2. **Loop and Return:**
   - Moved the `return` statement outside the loop so that `dp[-1]` (the result for the last position) is returned after processing all positions.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Added an additional edge case check for `n == 1`, which should handle cases with only one height.

This corrected version should compute the minimum energy required for the frog to jump across all heights efficiently.
